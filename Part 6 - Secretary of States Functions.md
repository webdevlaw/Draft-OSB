review.


(7) The report must be laid before Parliament.


#### EXPLANATORY NOTES FOR THIS SECTION

Part 6: Secretary of State’s Functions in Relation to Regulated Services
Strategic Priorities

Clause 109: Statement of strategic priorities

This clause introduces a power for the Secretary of State to designate and
publish a statement of strategic priorities in relation to online safety matters, and the
promotion of media literacy where this is relevant to online safety. The statement will
allow the government to set out the overall strategic direction for tackling online
harms and respond at a high level to future changes. This power is similar to the
existing power the Secretary of State has in the Communications Act 2003 in relation
to telecommunications, management of radio spectrum and postal services.
Subsection (1) specifies that in order to designate a statement of strategic
priorities, the Secretary of State must first consult and follow the parliamentary
procedure set out in clause 110.
Subsection (3) provides that the statement may specify particular outcomes to
deliver the strategic priorities. For example, the Secretary of State may set a target
eradication rate for child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) images online or look
to reduce regulatory burdens on companies.
Subsections (6) to (8) make provision for the amendment of a statement of
strategic priorities in whole or in part, by the issuing of a subsequent statement.
There are limited circumstances in which amendments may be made within a five
year period, including where there has been a significant change in government
policy affecting online safety matters.
Clause 110: Consultation and parliamentary procedure

This clause sets out the consultation and parliamentary procedure
requirements that must be satisfied before the Secretary of State can designate a
statement of strategic priorities under clause 109.
Subsection (2) states that the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM and
other persons the Secretary of State considers appropriate on a draft of the
statement. For example, the Secretary of State may wish to consult other
government departments, industry bodies, academics, policy institutes/think tanks, or
other regulators.
Subsection (3) provides for a period of at least 40 days for such consultation
with OFCOM, following which the Secretary of State must make any changes to the
draft statement that appear necessary to the Secretary of State and then lay the draft
statement before Parliament (subsection (4)).
Subsection (5) specifies that the Secretary of State must wait for the 40-day
period after laying the draft statement to expire before designating it. The statement
cannot be designated if either House of Parliament resolves not to approve the draft
statement during that 40-day period.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Directions to OFCOM

Clause 111: Secretary of State directions about advisory committees

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give OFCOM a direction to
establish an expert committee to give advice to OFCOM about the online safety
matters which the Secretary of State has specified in the direction.
The Secretary of State must consult OFCOM before issuing a direction, and
can vary or revoke the direction at any time. For example, this power could be used
in a scenario where there is growing concern around the understanding of members
of the public on the impact of social media on societal polarisation. It is unlikely that
the duty of care alone, which is limited to harm to individuals, would address this
issue. In consultation with OFCOM, the Secretary of State could direct OFCOM to
establish an advisory committee to facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue and build a
greater understanding of the issue.
Subsection (3) sets out that OFCOM must appoint a committee chair, and
that the number of members apart from the chair is at OFCOM’s discretion, unless
the direction specifies otherwise.
Subsection (4) places a duty on an advisory committee established under this
direction to publish a report within 18 months of it being established, and to report
periodically after that, unless the direction specifies otherwise.
Clause 112: Secretary of State directions in special circumstances

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give OFCOM directions in
circumstances where they consider there is a threat to the health or safety of the
public, or to national security. This includes directing OFCOM to prioritise action to
respond to such a specific threat when exercising its media literacy functions and to
require a service provider to publicly report on what steps it is taking to respond to
that threat.
Subsection (1) specifies the circumstances under which the Secretary of
State is able to issue directions under this clause, where the Secretary of State has
reasonable grounds to believe there is a threat to the health or safety of the public, or
to national security.
Subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State can direct OFCOM to give
priority for a specified period to specified objectives regarding OFCOM’s duty to
promote media literacy, as set out in section 11 of the Communications Act 2003, in
relation to broadcasting and electronic media. This provides the Secretary of State
with the option to step in to ensure that OFCOM is taking steps to address threats of
disinformation and misinformation.
Subsection (3) provides that the Secretary of State can direct OFCOM to
issue a public statement notice that requires providers of a regulated service to set
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
out the steps the provider is taking in response to the threat presented to the health
or safety of the public, or to national security.
Subsection (6) specifies that the Secretary of State must publish the reasons
for giving a direction related to OFCOM’s media literacy priorities or to require
OFCOM to give a public notice statement to service providers in circumstances
where there is a threat to the health or safety of the public. There is an exception to
the requirement of publishing the reasons for giving a direction where it relates to a
threat to national security, the Secretary of State can vary or revoke a direction at
any time. If so, OFCOM can vary or revoke the public statement notice it has given
pursuant to the Secretary of State’s direction: see subsection (7) and (8).
Guidance

Clause 113: Secretary of State guidance

This clause enables the Secretary of State to give guidance to OFCOM
relating to OFCOM’s exercise of its statutory powers and functions. The guidance will
provide clarity to OFCOM and others about how the Secretary of State expects
OFCOM to carry out its statutory functions. The Secretary of State must consult
OFCOM before issuing new guidance, or revising or replacing guidance: see
subsection (3). The Secretary of State must also publish any new, revised or
replacement guidance and lay it in Parliament: see subsections (6) and (7).
Subsection (1) states that the Secretary of State may give guidance to
OFCOM about the exercise of its functions under the Online Safety Bill. The
Secretary of State may also give guidance on the exercise of OFCOM’s general
powers and its media literacy functions under the Communications Act 2003.
Subsection (2) exempts guidance to OFCOM about fees and guidance about
OFCOM’s media literacy functions in relation to services other than regulated
services from the definition of ‘the guidance’, thereby excluding the requirements of
subsections (3) to (8) from applying to such guidance.
Subsection (4) states that the guidance should not be revised more frequently
than every three years, save for if one of the following two exceptions applies:
a. The guidance needs to be amended as a result of a change to the Online
Safety Act or to the media literacy provisions in the Communications Act
2003.
b. There is agreement between OFCOM and the Secretary of State that the
guidance should be revised or replaced.
Subsection (5) requires the guidance to be issued as one document.
Subsection (8) sets out OFCOM’s responsibilities in relation to the guidance.
Namely, OFCOM must have regard to the guidance when exercising any functions to
which the guidance relates or when considering whether or not to exercise such
functions.
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)
Annual Report

Clause 114: Annual report on the Secretary of State’s functions

Section 390 of the Communications Act 2003 requires the Secretary of State
to prepare and lay before Parliament annual reports about the performance of their
functions under specific legislation, including the Communications Act 2003, the
Office of Communications Act 2002 and the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996.
This clause amends the Communications Act 2003 by adding the functions
under this Bill to the list of functions which the Secretary of State must include in their
annual report to Parliament.
Review

Clause 115: Review

This clause provides for a review to be undertaken by the Secretary of State,
published and laid before Parliament, between 2 and 5 years after the duties on
services in Part 2 are commenced in order to assess the effectiveness of the
regulatory framework. The timing requirement (subclause (2)) is designed to ensure
there is adequate time to allow the regime to be in operation before the review takes
place, and that a review will take place in a timely manner.
Subsection (1) sets the scope of the review to the operation of (a) the
regulatory framework under the Online Safety Act and (b) section 11 of the
Communications Act 2003 (duty to promote media literacy) to the extent that that
section relates to online safety matters.
Subsection (3) specifies some of the areas the review must consider in
assessing the effectiveness of the regulatory framework. This includes the impact of
the systems and processes regulated services have put in place, and whether the
regulation of services is proportionate.
Subsection (4) specifies further areas that must be considered as part of the
review. These are the effectiveness of OFCOM’s information gathering, information
sharing and enforcement powers; the extent to which OFCOM has had regard to the
desirability of encouraging innovation; and whether it would be appropriate for
OFCOM to be able to exercise the power to require that a provider name a senior
manager in their response to an information notice (clause 71), in light of the
effectiveness of OFCOM’s power to require information using an information notice
(clause 70).

#### DELEGATED POWERS MEMORANDUM

PART 6: SECRETARY OF STATE’S FUNCTIONS IN RELATION TO REGULATED
SERVICES
Clause 109(1): Statement of strategic priorities

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Statement of strategic priorities
Parliamentary procedure: Specific procedure set out in clause 110

Context and purpose

This power will allow the Secretary of State to make a statement that sets out the
government's strategic priorities relating to online safety matters. The statement may,
among other things, set out particular outcomes identified with a view to achieving the
strategic priorities. A statement of strategic priorities for online harms will allow the
government to be clear on the overall strategic direction for tackling online harms and
respond at a high level to future changes.
Clause 110 requires that the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM, and such other
persons as considered appropriate on a draft of the statement. The final statement
must be published and laid in Parliament. The Secretary of State may not designate
the statement if either House of Parliament resolves not to approve it within 40 days
of being laid. OFCOM’s duties in relation to the statement of strategic priorities are set
out in clause 57. OFCOM must have regard to the statement when carrying out its
functions under the Bill and in relation to its general duties relating to online safety
matters and its duty to promote media literacy under the Communications Act 2003.
Within 40 days of the statement being designated, OFCOM must publish an
explanation of what it proposes to do in consequence of the statement and after 12
months (and every subsequent 12 months) must also publish a review of what it has
done during the period in question as a result of the statement.
Justification for the power

Delegating this power is necessary because of the potential for future changes in
technology impacting the experience of individuals and society online, including the
nature of online harms; this power therefore allows the government to respond to
developments and set its strategic priorities for addressing online harms. It is not
appropriate to set out such strategic priorities in primary legislation; by their nature
they will change over time.
The statement will be limited to high level strategic priorities. For example, it will not
be able to direct the regulator to take action against specific companies.
Justification for the procedure

Legislation will require that the statement is developed through engagement with
OFCOM and other persons that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. There
are also limits to how often this power can be used. Under subsections (6) and (7), no
amendment to the statement can be made within the period of 5 years of that
statement being made unless:
○ A Parliamentary general election has taken place;
○ There has been a significant change in the policy of Her Majesty’s
Government affecting online safety matters;
○ The Secretary of State considers that the statement, or any part of it,
conflicts with any of OFCOM’s general duties (Section 3 of the
Communications Act 2003).
This provision ensures that the government can respond to changes in technology
and policy, while ensuring Parliamentary oversight of such changes. This is not the
first time this approach has been taken. A similar procedure (negative resolution
procedure) is used under the Digital Economy Act 2017, which amended the
Communications Act 2003 to provide the Secretary of State with a power to make
statements setting strategic priorities relating to telecommunications, the
management of the radio spectrum, and postal services. Part 5 of the Energy Act
2013 also makes provision for the Secretary of State to designate a strategy and
policy statement.
As such, it is considered appropriate to maintain the same arrangements, with the
Secretary of State required to lay a draft of the statement before Parliament and
unable to designate the statement if either House resolves, within the 40-day period,
not to approve it.
Clause 111(1): Secretary of State directions about advisory committees

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Directions
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

Following consultation with OFCOM, the Secretary of State may give a direction
requiring OFCOM to establish an advisory committee to provide advice to OFCOM
about online safety matters of a kind specified in the direction. If a new online harm
emerged and became prevalent, including but not limited to online harms which are
not in scope of the duty of care, it may be appropriate to establish an advisory
committee to advise OFCOM about the issue. It is expected that OFCOM would share
advice with the government to inform policy development, including through the
requirement that advisory committees must publish a report within the period of 18
months after being established, and after that must publish periodic reports.
For example, this could be used in a scenario where there is growing concern around
the understanding of members of the public on the impact of social media on societal
polarisation. It is unlikely the duty of care alone, which is limited to harm to
individuals, would address this issue. In consultation with OFCOM, the government
could direct OFCOM to establish an advisory committee to facilitate multi-stakeholder
dialogue and build a greater understanding of the issue.
An advisory committee established by OFCOM would be a multi-stakeholder group of
individuals and representatives from relevant organisations who are brought together
to discuss a particular topic or issue, in this context, in relation to online harms.
OFCOM would determine the terms and the membership of the advisory committee,
and examples of its functions could include developing understanding of the issue,
providing non-binding recommendations about how service providers could address
the issue and building multi-stakeholder consensus. An advisory committee must,
unless the direction specifies otherwise, publish a report within the period of 18
months after being established, and after that must publish periodic reports. The
Secretary of State may vary or revoke a direction given under this section.
Justification for the power

It is expected that OFCOM would establish advisory committees as it sees fit and
would engage with the Secretary of State regularly. It is therefore envisaged that this
power would be used infrequently. OFCOM and the Secretary of State could agree
that an emerging issue merits the establishment of an advisory committee. This
power would not prevent OFCOM from establishing other advisory committees should
OFCOM wish to do so. However, this power will provide the Secretary of State with
the ability to direct OFCOM to establish an advisory committee, where necessary and
following consultation with OFCOM, to ensure that OFCOM is addressing emerging
threats to online safety.
This power will help to future-proof the regime and ensure that the Secretary of State
is empowered to deal with future challenges by creating an avenue to understand and
help tackle emerging issues which may not be in scope of the duty of care, without
creating additional requirements on companies. It could be used to demonstrate that
the government and OFCOM recognise the importance of the issue and could help
build evidence and understanding to inform policy development.
There are clear limitations on this power. The Secretary of State is required to consult
with OFCOM before using the direction making power. While it allows the Secretary of
State to direct OFCOM to undertake a specific and limited task, it does not infringe on
OFCOM’s decision making powers or interfere with its regulatory responsibilities. The
recommendations provided by the advisory committee would not be binding, and it
would be at OFCOM’s discretion to act on advice. This power would not prevent
OFCOM from establishing other advisory committees should it wish to do so.
Justification for the procedure

There is no procedure for this power on the basis that the scope of the power is
limited and the Secretary of State will need to consult OFCOM on use of this direction
making power. An advisory committee established under this direction would have no
power to set requirements on businesses, and OFCOM would be under no obligation
to act on its advice.
The power is operational and non-legislative.
Clause 112(2) and (3): Secretary of State directions in special circumstances

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Directions
Parliamentary procedure: None

Context and purpose

If the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds for believing that circumstances
exist that present a threat to the health or safety of the public, or to national security,
the Secretary of State will be able to give specific directions to OFCOM to deal with
that threat by directing OFCOM’s media literacy activity and requiring OFCOM to give
a public notice statement to service providers. The power in this clause ensures that
the regulatory framework can respond to future threats.
Under subsection (2), the Secretary of State may give OFCOM a direction to give
priority for a specified period to specified objectives designed to address the threat
presented to the health or safety of the public, or to national security, in exercising
their media literacy functions (under section 11 of the Communications Act 2003). It is
expected that in such a scenario, OFCOM would direct media literacy priorities as it
sees fit. This power will provide the Secretary of State with the ability to ensure that
OFCOM is addressing threats to online safety. The Secretary of State must consult
with OFCOM before giving the direction.
Under subsection (3), the Secretary of State may give OFCOM a direction requiring
OFCOM to give a public statement notice to a specified provider of a regulated
service, or providers of regulated services generally. This is a notice requiring a
provider of a regulated service to make a publicly available statement, by a date
specified in the notice, about steps the provider is taking in response to the threat
presented to the health or safety of the public, or to national security. For example, in
the event that there is concern about the impact of social media on societal
polarisation and a growing risk of public disorder as a result, a provider of a regulated
service would be required by OFCOM to make a publicly available statement about
the steps they are taking in response to this threat.
The Secretary of State may vary or revoke a direction given under both subsections.
If the Secretary of State varies or revokes a direction given under subsection (4),
OFCOM may, in consequence, vary or revoke a public statement notice that it has
given by virtue of the direction.
Justification for the power

This power ensures that the framework is equipped to respond to future threats in
circumstances where there is a threat to the health or safety of the public, or to
national security, for example where there may be an increased risk of certain types
of disinformation and misinformation proliferating online.
For example, a coordinated disinformation campaign attempting to undermine the
efficacy of vaccines would constitute a threat to the health or safety of the public. This
would be addressed, primarily, through the duty of care. This power will support the
duty of care by ensuring the Secretary of State has the option to ensure that OFCOM
is taking steps to reduce the negative impacts of particular types of disinformation and
misinformation.
In both subsections, “specified” means specified in the direction. Providing the
Secretary of State with discretion as to how to define those terms when directions are
made ensures that any directions are proportionate, targeted and effective.
There are clear limits to the use of this power. Both directions provided under this
section are limited powers which do not affect the fundamental principles of the
regulatory framework. The Secretary of State must consult with OFCOM before giving
the direction. The Secretary of State can direct OFCOM to give priority only for a
specified period to specified objectives regarding OFCOM’s duty to promote media
literacy.
Further, the Secretary of State must publish the reasons for giving a direction in
circumstances where there is a threat to the health or safety of the public under
subsection (2) or (3), providing oversight and transparency. There is an exception to
the requirement of publishing the reasons for giving a direction where it relates to a
threat to national security.
Justification for the procedure

There is precedent in section 132 of the Communications Act 2003 for the conditions
specified for the use of this power, where the Secretary of State has reasonable
grounds for believing that circumstances exist that present a threat to the health or
safety of the public, or to national security. This procedure is proportionate because
the power does not alter the regulatory framework and does not place significant
duties or expectations on either companies or the regulator.
All directions created under this section must be published. This power requires close
engagement with OFCOM.
Clause 113(1): Secretary of State guidance

Power conferred on: Secretary of State
Power exercised by: Guidance
Parliamentary procedure: Must be laid before Parliament

Context and purpose

This clause will enable the Secretary of State to give guidance to OFCOM about
OFCOM’s exercise of its functions under the Bill, and its functions and general
powers under the Communications Act 2003 including its functions relating to media
literacy under section 11 of the Communications Act. Before issuing, revising or
replacing the guidance, the Secretary of State must consult OFCOM. The guidance
must be issued as one document and will not contain guidance on fees made under
clause 54. The Secretary of State will be able to revise or replace the guidance but no
more than once every three years, unless agreed between the Secretary of State and
OFCOM or if the guidance needs to be corrected because of an amendment to a
provision of this Bill or section 11 of the Communications Act 2003 (media literacy).
Justification for the power

This power allows the Secretary of State to provide guidance to OFCOM on carrying
out its statutory functions in order to comply with the Online Safety legislation. This
guidance must be aligned with the Online Safety legislation and any other existing
legislative requirements on OFCOM.
Delegation is necessary because, as this is a new regulatory regime, this will allow
the Secretary of State to provide clarity to the regulator and others by setting out how
they expect OFCOM to carry out its statutory functions in order to comply with the
legislation. The legislation will set a clear regulatory framework and this guidance will
not create any additional requirements. However, should it be needed, it will allow for
further information to be provided on specific areas to guide OFCOM in exercising its
functions. A similar power exists under section 4(5)(a) and section 4(5B) of the
Railways Act 1993.
Justification for the procedure

This power is restricted in its frequency and impact, and requires close engagement
with OFCOM.
The Secretary of State must lay the guidance (including revised or replacement
guidance) before Parliament and must publish the guidance (and any revised or
replacement guidance). In general, it is not considered appropriate for any type of
Parliamentary scrutiny to apply to this guidance because it concerns administrative
and operational matters and is not legislative in character.
The primary legislation will state only that OFCOM must have regard to the guidance
when exercising any functions to which the guidance relates.
