strengthens the existing duty, and applies the duty in relation to online safety.
New subsection (1) provides that OFCOM must take action to improve the
media literacy of UK users and encourage regulated service providers and
broadcasters to use and develop tools which can improve people’s digital media
literacy. This includes technologies and systems which help users to identify what
These explanatory notes relate to the Online Safety Bill as published in draft on 12 May 2021 (Bill CP 405)

type of material they are seeing (for example sponsored content), how reliable and
accurate content it is, and how users can control the material they receive.
New subsection (3) specifies that in performing its duty, OFCOM must deliver,
commission, or encourage education initiatives aimed at improving media literacy
rates for UK citizens. This is a new requirement and could include, for example,
public awareness campaigns or providing training to improve the skills of teachers.
New subsection (4) requires OFCOM to issue guidance on how to evaluate
media literacy initiatives and actions. The aim of the guidance is to help improve the
quality of evaluations of media literacy initiatives, and to improve overall
understanding of what efforts are effective in building long-term media literacy
understanding in individuals.
New subsection (8) specifies that OFCOM’s annual report must contain a
summary of the steps that they have taken to fulfil their expanded duty to promote
media literacy in relation to the relevant financial year.
